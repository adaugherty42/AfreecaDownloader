# AfreecaDownloader

A python program to aid in downloading VODs (videos on demand) from the popular South Korean streaming website Afreeca. Afreeca uses a fairly arcane video delivery system which make it impossible to download videos from a web browser, and even a challenge for download managers such as JDownloader.

This is a work in progress as I add a GUI to make the process more streamlined, but the underlying program is fully functional for a video URL passed in via the command line.
